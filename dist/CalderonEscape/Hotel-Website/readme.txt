CHANGELOG: 

Added the header and footer with contact information and social links

Added the rest of the navbar links to the navbar (didnt add the href, as I dont know the other page names)

Lowered the dots on the jumbotron

Realigned the arrows on the jumbotron to stay consistent with different resolutions

Fixed the logo band in the middle(Logo was cut off before)

Fixed the flex display, added the links to the properties

Added a page for the Huancaro Condo

Added header, navbar, and jumbotron to the condo page

Added appropriate images to jumbotron on the condo page

Reorganized the file structure of the project

WHEN RUNNING ON YOUR MACHINE:

Download the whole folder, as the layout of the files is different(more organized)

TO DO:

Add a section above the slideshow on the condo page that acts as an introduction. Maybe says 'EXPLORE', tells a bit about the condo
, not sure what this page needs. Needs clarification.

STRECH GOALS:

Make jumbotron display more aesthetic, the different photo resolutions make it difficult to have them all on the same
banner slideshow. Cropping the images makes them look less presentable.

NEEDS CLARIFICATION:

I am not sure what content is desired on the 2 property pages. I added a jumbotron, and will add some text above it,
but other than that I need more instructions on what other content should exist on the page.

Do I need to add a review section to the home page? I can do that, but I'm not sure if someone else is already working on it.


Will continue work tonight.
